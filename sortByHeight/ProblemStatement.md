# Problem Statement

Some people are standing in a row in a park. There are trees between them which cannot be moved. 
Your task is to rearrange the people by their heights in a non-descending order without moving the 
trees which are represented by the 0's.

### Test case:
sortByHeight([3, 0, 0, 1, 8, 2, 0]) should return [1, 0, 0, 2, 3, 8, 0]

### Please solve in time complexity of O(n^2) or O(n)

```js
function sortByHeight(a) {

}
```
